Make sure your furry friend gets his meals on time with this app and an Arduino.
Simple open-sourced app that works with a Bluetooth enabled Arduino to make sure your furry (or not so furry) friend gets his meals on time!

Set up a weekly schedule

Set up your pet's daily and weekly schedule, along with how many servings for each meal with a beautiful interface, and everything else is handled in the background and synchronized with your Arduino.

View useful statistics about your pet
---
Check up on his daily average diet, his feeding history.

No-Frills feeding
---
If somebody gets a little too hungry, get your pet an instant feed without any scheduling setup with the 'FEED NOW' button. Just select how many servings and your good to go.

Simple Arduino management
---
Easily connect and disconnect to your Arduino, view the serial log and synchronize with your Arduino with a simple push of the button. You can also find additional configurations for your Arduino from the settings screen.

Build it yourself
---
Build any contraption, connect it to your Arduino, hook-up a Bluetooth module and that's it. Just make sure you follow the App Interface so the Arduino and the app speak the same language.
We'll soon be putting up the Arduino code to bump up progress with your contraption.
